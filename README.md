# Vulnerability prediction using source code metrics
**Authors:** Sundarakrishnan Ganesh and Dr. Francis Palma. 
## File structure
The project has been structured as follows:
1. "/datasets" - to collect all the vulnerability datasets for relevant open source projects.
2. "/images" - to store all the images / screenshots, which are required to explain the process.
3. "apache-tomcat-vulnerability-prediction-models.ipynb" - the notebook file where updates are conducted iteratively. This is the file where the experimentation is done and observations are noted.
4. "ml-models.ipynb" - the file where a stable iterative conclusion of an experiment is stored.
5. "sonarqube-comparison.ipynb" - the file where the results produced by sonarqube is compared with the results produced by our machine learning models.
## Currently in progress
1. ~~Adding more advanced machine learning models / ensemble learning techniques to the system.~~
2. ~~Adding newer systems like Struts2-core.~~
3. Weighted methods to improve precision / recall.
4. Fixing overfitting and other issues.
