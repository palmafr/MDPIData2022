# Vulnerability prediction using source code metrics
**Authors:** Sundarakrishnan Ganesh, Dr. Francis Palma and Tobias Ohlsson

## File structure
The project has been structured as follows:
1. "/datasets" - to collect all the vulnerability datasets for relevant open source projects.
2. "/images" - to store all the images / screenshots, which are required to explain the process.
3. "/old_files" - the directory where all the deprecated files are stored.
4. "/experiments" - the directory with all the .ipynb files required for each conducted experiment.
5. "ml-models.ipynb" - the file where a stable iterative conclusion of an experiment is stored.

## Currently in progress
1. ~~Adding more advanced machine learning models / ensemble learning techniques to the system.~~
2. ~~Adding newer systems like Struts2-core.~~
3. Hyper-parameter tuning using GridSearchCV. (**DROPPED**)
4. ~~Optimized ensemble implementation.~~
5. ~~Weighted methods to improve precision / recall.~~
6. ~~Cross checking experiments.~~

## Future work
1. Neural network implementation.
2. Data Normalization between datasets.
